This project is a reimplementation of several simple python games. Along with the redesign of these games we are designing a launcher
for these minigames to select which game the user would like to play.

Responsibilities are as follows:

    Andrew: Maze game
    William: Scoreboard
    Jame: Flappy
    Arshan: Pong and future games

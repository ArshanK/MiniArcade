# MiniArcade

Group project for SFWRENG 3XA3
Team Members and Responsibilities:

    Arshan Khan | Pong  
    Andrew Hum | Maze

This project is a reimplementation of several simple python games. Along with the redesign of these games we are designing a launcher for these minigames to select which game the user would like to play.

Any future updates or work by **Arshan Khan** will be recorded here.

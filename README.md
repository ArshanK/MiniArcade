# MiniArcade

Group project for SFWRENG 3XA3 in the Winter 2020 session.
Team Members and Responsibilities:

    Arshan Khan | Pong  
    Andrew Hum | Maze 
    William Lei | Scoreboard  
    Jame Tran | Flappy

This project is a reimplementation of several simple python games. Along with the redesign of these games we are designing a launcher for these minigames to select which game the user would like to play. The arrow keys are used for the main game controls; extra game controls (if any) are specified in each game.

Any future updates or work by **Arshan Khan** will be recorded here.
